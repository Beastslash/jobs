# The Manager (English)
## Character description
If The Manager had to pick between 20 cents and saving you from the grinder, you best hope that you already made a will. The Manager is the shopkeeper of The Dreamstone Shop, a place where players can spend their Dreamstone in exchange for dangerous weapons.

The Manager has a "money guarantee" â€” not to be confused with a "money-back guarantee". The Manager knows that they *will* get your money, and looks forward to your business. Word of advice for new customers: never ask for a refund. Soon after my friend asked, someone found him floating down a river.
