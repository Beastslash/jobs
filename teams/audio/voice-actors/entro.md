# Entro (English)
## Character personality
Entro is a demon with a mission: host the best game show the universe's ever seen. Entro's the playful emcee of DemoDemons, a competition where powerful beings destroy the terrain and anyone who dares to get in their way.

Sometimes, Entro lets players break the rules in the name of fun. The only rule they follow to the tee is the time limit, probably so the commercials play on time. Entro threw a brick at a player for still playing after the timer went off.

Entro is spontaneous and loves to improvise. If they think of an idea for the game, they'll mess around and find out regardless of the consequences. The only forces they succumb to are Standards and Practices and their Demon General boss.
